# Building a weather app with vanilla JavaScript

Based on the following tutorial:

This was, however, based on Dark Sky API which is no longer available, so I have modified the project to use the OpenWeather API instead.

## OpenWeather API
https://openweathermap.org/current#data

The tutorial also used animated icons designed to work with the Dark Sky API, which I still really wanted to use, so I created a map between the OpenWeather codes and a relevant Skycons icon so that I could still use them. I've mapped the IDs to the OpenWeather icon IDs (iconMap.js) listed here: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions

## Skycons
